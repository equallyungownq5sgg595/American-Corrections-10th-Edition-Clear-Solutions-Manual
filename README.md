Comprehensive yet not overwhelming, the book covers both institutional and community sanctions, incorporating high-profile corrections cases taken from recent headlines to reinforce important theories. The authors "tell it like it is," offering you thought-provoking, unbiased examinations of such topics as assisting felons during the re-entry process, reducing recidivism, the death penalty, and surveillance. You'll also get a frontline view of careers in the corrections field.
